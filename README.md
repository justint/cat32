Play with a cat that follows your mouse around the screen!

Download usable binaries [here](https://github.com/octop1/cat32/releases).

Code originally pulled from (http://lexa.tatalata.com/the-desktop-cat/), none of the original code from inital commit is by me. Further patches are revisions/updates to the source.
